# Email_spam_classification
This project implements a machine learning model to classify incoming emails as spam or not spam. It's designed to help you:

Reduce clutter: Filter out unwanted spam emails from your inbox, saving you time and keeping your inbox focused on important messages.
Enhance security: Spam messages often contain phishing attempts or malicious links. This classifier can help prevent you from falling victim to such attacks.
Improve productivity: Stop wasting time sifting through spam and focus on the emails that truly matter.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Model: Leverages a trained model (e.g., MultinomialNB) to analyze email content and predict spam probability.
Text Preprocessing: Employs techniques like stemming, tokenization, and stopword removal to enhance model accuracy.
Streamlit Integration (Optional): Provides a user-friendly interface for testing the model and classifying new emails (requires Streamlit library).
